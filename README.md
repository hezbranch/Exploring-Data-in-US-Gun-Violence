# Exploring-Data-in-US-Gun-Violence

This project analyzes gun deaths data from the US census and takes a deeper look at how the gender and race of an American citizen affects the probability of being a victim to gun violence. Specifically, the factors that are examined include the type of crime, the season in which the crime was committed, the demographics, and the reliablity of the data provided.
